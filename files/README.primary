This directory and its subdirectories are used for primary zone files.

The zone files are organized by top and second level domains:

Zone            | Subdirectory
----------------+-------------
example.net     | net/example/
10.in-addr.arpa | arpa/in-addr/

All files and directories are managed by Puppet!
